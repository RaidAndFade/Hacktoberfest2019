# Hacktoberfest2019 ~ Week 1 Challenge

*This is part of a series of weekly projects that will be in this repository over the span of hacktoberfest.*
*this is satire, it's meant to be cute and to see what potential PRs have (both during hacktoberfest and otherwise), as well as improve my management skills & my auto-auditing program and its submodules.*


Make sure to add yourself to the [contributors file](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/Hacktoberfest2019/blob/master/contributors.md).

## Just Say Yes...

Raid is sick and tired of having to say yes manually so many times. He needs a script that just says yes forever. 

## How can I help?!

Raid needs to say yes in every single programming language on earth. If you know a language that is not already here, please help raid say yes.

***TEMPLATE***

Your file must print ``yes`` forever - or until I decided that I've had enough and want to stop saying yes.

Here is an example of what you could do. Python is already taken.

```python
# By RaidAndFade - https://github.com/RaidAndFade

while True:
    print("yes")
```

## RULES 

1. Your submission must be in the `Yes` directory `Yes/yes.{language}`
2. Your submission must NOT be a duplicate of someone else's submission. It MUST be UNIQUE (the language MUST be UNIQUE, the sample MUST be UNIQUE).
3. Make sure to say who made it at the top of the file, using a comment.
4. The submissions are checked automatically, if the submission is marked as needs-work, this means your code is missing functionality somewhere.
5. No Malicious Code (cookie sniffing, iframe hacking, css local file stealing, ios rootkits, CPU Monero Miners)
6. No NSFW (porn, nudes, pictures of your cat's testicles, severed heads)
7. No ADS (No advertising your product, No third party ads)
8. DO NOT MODIFY OTHER PEOPLE'S SUBMISSIONS. THESE PRS WILL BE INSTANTLY DENIED AND MARKED SPAM.

## But why is this a challenge?

The point of this challenge is a simple test to start off Hacktoberfest with a tiny script. This sort of problem has been done many times before so for a seasoned programmer this should be very easy, and for new programmers it should be easy enough that they can figure it out quickly.

## Final note

Remember to check that your codes work by testing it beforehand! The template provided is VERY strict, you must follow the exact template in order to be merged.
